# Simple Task Manager (Java Swing)

This is a basic desktop task management application built using Java Swing.  
It allows users to:

- Add tasks
- Mark tasks as completed
- Save tasks to a local file (`tasks.txt`)

## How to Run

1. Compile all `.java` files:
```
javac *.java
```

2. Run the application:
```
java TaskManagerGUI
```

All tasks are stored in a simple `tasks.txt` file in the project directory.
